# 🗂️ Hadoop Architecture & HDFS Metadata Explained

## 📌 Hadoop Cluster Overview

A Hadoop cluster is a group of machines (nodes) working together to store and process large data sets using the Hadoop ecosystem.

### 🧭 Edge Node (Gateway Node)

- Acts as the **entry point** to the Hadoop cluster.
- Users connect using tools like **PuTTY** or **MobaXterm**.
- Runs Hadoop or Linux commands:
  - Hadoop commands → Forwarded to the cluster.
  - Linux commands → Executed on the edge node itself.

## 🧱 Hadoop Cluster Node Types

### 🔷 Master Nodes
- **NameNode**: Stores metadata about files and blocks.
- **Secondary NameNode**: Performs checkpointing (not a backup).

### 🔷 Slave Nodes
- **DataNodes**: Store actual data blocks and send heartbeats to the NameNode.

## 💾 What is HDFS?

HDFS stands for **Hadoop Distributed File System** — it’s the **storage layer** of Hadoop.

### Key Features:
- Distributed storage with fault tolerance.
- Data split into large blocks (128 MB or more).
- Blocks are **replicated** (default 3x) across DataNodes.
- Designed for high-throughput, batch processing.
- **Write-once, read-many** access model.

## 🧩 Example of File Storage in HDFS

Uploading a 500MB file with 128MB block size:

- Split into 4 blocks: 128MB, 128MB, 128MB, 116MB
- Each block is replicated on 3 different DataNodes.

## 📘 HDFS Metadata: `fsimage` and `edits`

The NameNode keeps track of HDFS files using two files:

### `fsimage` (File System Image)
- Snapshot of the entire file system's metadata.
- Shows the state at the last checkpoint.

### `edits` (Edit Log)
- Records **all changes** since the last checkpoint (e.g. file additions, deletions).

### How They Work Together:
1. On NameNode restart:
   - Load `fsimage`
   - Replay `edits`
2. Keeps file system metadata up to date.

---

## 🛠️ Role of the Secondary NameNode

- Merges `fsimage` + `edits` to create a new `fsimage`.
- This process is called **checkpointing**.
- Prevents `edits` file from growing too large.

## ✅ Summary

| Component         | What It Stores                     | Purpose                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `fsimage`         | Full snapshot of metadata           | Quick load on restart            |
| `edits`           | Incremental metadata changes        | Tracks ongoing updates           |
| Secondary NameNode| Merges metadata (`fsimage + edits`) | Maintains NameNode performance   |

# 🔄 Communication Between NameNode and DataNodes

In a Hadoop ecosystem, the **NameNode** serves as the centralized metadata manager, while the **DataNodes** function as the actual storage providers within the distributed file system. A well-orchestrated and continuous communication flow between these two components is critical to ensuring **data integrity**, **cluster health**, and **system performance**.

## 📡 How DataNodes Interact with the NameNode

### 1. Heartbeat Signals
- DataNodes periodically transmit **heartbeat messages** to the NameNode *(default: every 3 seconds)*.
- **Purpose**: To confirm that they are operational and responsive.
- If a heartbeat is not received within a specific threshold *(default: 10.5 minutes)*, the DataNode is marked as **dead**. The blocks it stored are scheduled for **replication** on other healthy DataNodes.

### 2. Block Reports
- At regular intervals *(default: every 6 hours)*, DataNodes send a **comprehensive block report**.
- This report contains details of **every data block** held on the DataNode.
- The NameNode uses this to maintain a reliable map of block locations and replication states.

### 3. Data Transfer Requests
- During file write operations, the NameNode identifies **target DataNodes** for block storage.
- The client is then directed to write the data **directly to those DataNodes**, minimizing load on the NameNode.
- For file reads, the NameNode provides **block locations**, and the client fetches data directly from the DataNodes.

### 4. Replication and Rebalancing
- Based on heartbeat and block report analysis, the NameNode may issue instructions to:
  - **Replicate** blocks that have fallen below the desired replication factor.
  - **Delete** blocks that exceed the replication threshold.
  - **Move blocks** to balance disk usage or decommission nodes.

### 5. Command Queue
- The NameNode maintains a **per-node command queue**.
- This queue includes actions like:
  - Block replication
  - Block deletion
  - Data balancing
- Commands are included in the heartbeat response and executed by the corresponding DataNode.

## 🧠 Summary

> The interaction model between NameNode and DataNodes exemplifies a **master-worker relationship**, wherein the NameNode governs **metadata and orchestration**, while DataNodes handle **storage and execution**. This separation of concerns not only enhances **scalability** but also provides robust **fault tolerance** through systematic replication and monitoring mechanisms.
